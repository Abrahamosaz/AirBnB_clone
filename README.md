<h1>AirBnB_clone - The Console</h1>

<h2>Description of the project</h2>

The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

We won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:

   <h3>.</h3> A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
   <h3>.</h3> A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
   <h3>.</h3> A database or files that store data (data = objects)
   <h3>.</h3> An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

<h2> Description of the command interpreter: </h2>

A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program. Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

   <h3>.</h3> Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
   <h3>.</h3> Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
   <h3>.</h3> Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
   <h3>.</h3> Update attributes of an object
   <h3>.</h3> Destroy an object
